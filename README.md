============

Steps:

- Install NPM, Node, Grunt, Bower, Yeoman, Angular-generator, Cordova, Ruby, SASS, Compass globally. anyting else???

$ npm install -g grunt
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-angular
$ npm install -g cordova

- Install Git and add to path - should already be done if you have access to this project
- Install gitHub for Windows also - same caveat as above
- Install Java 7 SDK and set JAVA_HOME and add to path
- Install  ANT and set ANT_HOME and add to path
- Install IOS SDK, maybe in future if I own a Mac and can build for IOS!!!!
- Install Android SDK
	- Then using SDK manager enable v19
	- Then create a AVD using AVD manager to use as your emulator

There will be teething problems.
